### Part 5: 
Installed Firebase and created a collection with product fields. 
created firebase.js and entered information from config (imported firebase from "firebase", initializedApp and created db and exported).
When I go ahead and pull data from firebase , what's going to happen is I'm going to save that in a state and it's a snapshot and time of the actual application. So app will have a state of products.

What's going to happen is these products are going to go into a database of the app itself.
If I have it in the state , using that state I can actually go ahead and show it on the actual web page.
This is a flow: we get it from DB, say it to the state from the state show it on the web page. When we add New products , everytime you out to the state. So, React updates automatically. Also installed react-slick and slick-carousel to make Home slider for home page.


### Part 6: 
Created and designed Footer & Categories component.

### Part 7: 
I needed to devide CartItem component into rows and colomuns, so for that I created following componenents (ImageContainer,CartItemInfo,CartItemInfoTop,DetailsContainer,PrimeContainer, Prime,GiftContainer,Checkbox,ProductDetailsContainer,ProductDetails,CartItemInfoBottom,CartItemQuantityContainer,CartItemDeleteContainer,CartItemPrice,PriceContainer,PrimeShippingContainer).
It has 2 horizontal and 1 a vertical component.
