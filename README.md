# Amazon-Clone

## It’s a complete e-commerce web application with a payment process.

Part 1: Created components (Header, Home and Checkout), Header CSS, installed Material-UI icons and created Routes and Links.

Part 2: Created Home.css and added styles. Added Homepage image to the home page.

Part 3 : Created DataBase with products and images.

Part 4 : Passed products as props to a .map on my data arrays to products , then I deconstructed product from my component function and included every detail into the products components.

Part 5: Installed Firebase and created a collection with product fields. 
created firebase.js and entered information from config (imported firebase from "firebase", initializedApp and created db and exported).
When I go ahead and pull data from firebase , what's going to happen is I'm going to save that in a state and it's a snapshot and time of the actual application. So app will have a state of products.
What's going to happen is these products are going to go into a database of the app itself.
If I have it in the state , using that state I can actually go ahead and show it on the actual web page.
This is a flow: we get it from DB, say it to the state from the state show it on the web page. When we add New products , everytime you out to the state. So, React updates automatically. Also installed react-slick and slick-carousel to make Home slider for home page.
